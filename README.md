    **^ (use with brave browser) ^**

( NOTE: Brave currently doesn't support procedural cosmetic filtering such as :has-text(foo) , 
so i split the mobile version & made a seperate one for ios. )

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS: ( under construction )


these filter lists and are intended to be used with ublock origin, but u can also use brave if on ios.


### setup on desktop:
- Download the ublock origin addon for either firefox or chrome.
- go to the ublock settings
- select filter lists, scroll down & paste the link to the desktop version under the import option
- click on apply changes

### setup on mobile:
